**Who are you? What is your background?**

My name is Lucas Gowland, I hold an economics and finance bachelor degree as well as a capital markets masters degree. Today, I am trying to build upon my technological skill set in order to gain coding and data analysis experience which will then be applied in the capital markets.

My goal is to pivot from capital markets into the FinTech space. I seek to be able to automize financial process and gain workflow efficiency.


**Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?**

I believe that FinTech solutions will be a pivital theme in the future markets. Being able to efficiently measure risks associated with the capital markets will be a common theme in the FinTech space. # CU-bootcamp-lesson3
